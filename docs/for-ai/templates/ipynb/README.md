# Jupyter Notebook Templates

This directory contains templates for creating different types of Jupyter notebooks in the AllAboutV2 project.

## ⚠️ Quick Validation Check

**Before deploying any navigation notebook:**

1. ✅ Every transition cell (with "Part X:", Progress, 🔵) has `<!-- action-cards -->` marker
2. ✅ Each transition has 3-6 action card links
3. ✅ All action card links resolve to existing headings
4. ✅ Run `/validate-notebook your-notebook.ipynb`

**This catches 80% of validation failures.** Missing action cards in transitions is the #1 issue.

## Cell Ordering Best Practices

**CRITICAL:** Proper cell ordering is essential for navigation notebooks. Following these patterns ensures logical flow and prevents user confusion.

### Correct Structure Pattern

```
Introduction Section (Cells 0-N)
  → Hero cell with main navigation
  → Table of Contents
  → Emergency navigation
  → Essential bookmarks

Part 1 Section
  → Part 1 content cells
  → Part 1 completion/summary cell

Part 2 Transition Cell (with action cards)
  → Part 2 start cell
  → Part 2 content cells
  → Part 2 completion/summary cell

Part 3 Transition Cell
  → Part 3 start cell
  → Part 3 content cells
  → Part 3 completion/summary cell

...continue for all parts...

Reference Section (End of notebook)
  → Resources & Quick Reference
  → Essential Bookmarks
  → Your Next Steps
  → Troubleshooting Navigation Issues

Final Wrap-Up
  → "Remember - Living Documentation" reflection
  → End/Closing cell
```

### Common Cell Ordering Mistakes

❌ **WRONG:** Completion cell BEFORE part content
```
Part 8 Completion Cell (index 69)
Part 8 START Cell (index 70)
Part 8 Content...
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Completion cell AFTER all part content
```
Part 8 START Cell (index 63)
Part 8 Content Cells (indices 64-71)
Part 8 Completion Cell (index 72)
```

❌ **WRONG:** Reference cells BETWEEN parts
```
Part 6 Completion
Resources & Quick Reference ← Interrupts flow
Essential Bookmarks ← Interrupts flow
Part 7 Transition
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Reference cells at END of notebook
```
Part 6 Completion
Part 7 Transition (immediately adjacent)
Part 7 Content...
Part 8 Content...
Part 8 Completion
Resources & Quick Reference ← At end
Essential Bookmarks ← At end
Final Wrap-Up
```

❌ **WRONG:** Technical detail cells orphaned outside their section
```
Part 7 Content
Code Examples ← Orphaned
CSS Classes ← Orphaned
Auto-Wrapping Detection ← Orphaned
Part 8 START
```

✅ **CORRECT:** Technical cells within their parent section
```
Part 8 START
Performance Stats
Code Examples ← Inside Part 8
CSS Classes ← Inside Part 8
Auto-Wrapping Detection ← Inside Part 8
Try It Yourself
Part 8 Completion
```

### Validation Checks

Before deploying, verify:

```python
# Check 1: Parts are adjacent (no gaps)
part_6_completion_idx + 1 == part_7_transition_idx  # Must be true

# Check 2: Completion after content
part_8_start_idx < part_8_completion_idx  # Must be true

# Check 3: Reference section at end
part_8_completion_idx < reference_section_idx < final_wrap_idx  # Must be true

# Check 4: Technical cells within section
part_8_start_idx < technical_cell_idx < part_8_completion_idx  # Must be true
```

### Automatic Validation

Use the validation command to check structure:

```bash
/validate-notebook your-notebook.ipynb
```

This checks:
- ✅ Cell ordering and adjacency
- ✅ Completion cell placement
- ✅ Reference cell location
- ✅ Technical cell containment
- ✅ Part flow and gaps

### Real-World Example

See [docs-navigation.ipynb](../../../../docs-navigation.ipynb) for perfect cell ordering:
- 75 cells total
- 8 parts sequentially numbered
- All completions after content
- Reference section at end (indices 69-72)
- No gaps between parts
- All technical cells within Part 8

## Closing Cell Pattern

**Best Practice:** Every navigation notebook should end with a proper closing cell that:

1. **Thanks the user** - Acknowledge their time and effort
2. **Summarizes achievements** - List what they've learned
3. **Provides quick reminders** - Key bookmarks and commands
4. **Encourages action** - "Happy building!" or similar
5. **Attributes the system** - Footer line crediting the documentation system

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
## 📖 End of Documentation Navigator

**Thank you for exploring this guide!**

You've completed the full journey through [System Name]. You now have:

✅ Understanding of all [N] documentation categories
✅ Role-based, task-based, and workflow-based strategies
✅ Knowledge of [N] pro tips

**Quick reminders:**
- Bookmark [doc1.md], [doc2.md], [doc3.md]
- Use commands/tools as needed
- Return when you need guidance

**Happy building! 🚀**

---

*This Documentation Navigator is part of [Project Name].*
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Provides psychological closure
- ✅ Reinforces key takeaways when fresh in memory
- ✅ Encourages bookmarking essential resources
- ✅ Sets positive tone for applying what was learned
- ✅ Creates sense of completion and achievement

**See Examples:**
- [docs-navigation.ipynb](../../../../docs-navigation.ipynb) - Cell at end after "Remember - This IS Living Documentation"
- [navigation-template.ipynb](navigation-template.ipynb) - Includes example closing cell

---

## Action Cards for Navigation

**NEW:** Create beautiful navigation links using action cards with smart linking:

```markdown
# Getting Started Guide

Learn step by step through these topics.

<!-- action-cards -->

- [Installation](#)
- [Your First Block](#)
- [Advanced Topics](#)
```

**How it works:**
1. Add `<!-- action-cards -->` HTML comment in your markdown cell
2. Follow with a markdown list of links using `(#)` as placeholder
3. Write link text that matches heading text somewhere in your notebook
4. **Links are automatically resolved at runtime** - JavaScript searches all cells for matching headings and updates hrefs
5. All cards use consistent blue styling

**Important:** The `<!-- action-cards -->` marker only applies to the **first list** that follows it. Any subsequent lists in the same cell will remain as normal bullet lists.

**Example:**
```markdown
<!-- In hero cell -->
- [Installation](#)  <!-- Will find "## Installation" or "### Installation Guide" -->
- [Basic Concepts](#)  <!-- Will find "## Part 1: Basic Concepts" -->
```

The link text doesn't need to match exactly - it searches for headings that *contain* your link text.

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use specific link text: `[Part 1: Introduction](#)` instead of just `[Introduction](#)`
- ✅ Make link text unique to avoid ambiguity
- ⚠️ If multiple headings match, it picks the **first one found** (in cell order)
- 💡 Tip: Use part numbers or descriptive prefixes to ensure unique matches

**Features:**
- ✅ Pure markdown - no HTML required
- ✅ Works in any cell type (hero, content, intro, transition)
- ✅ **Smart link resolution** - No hardcoded cell IDs needed
- ✅ Automatically finds matching headings at runtime
- ✅ Consistent blue design - professional appearance
- ✅ Perfect for hero cells and section navigation

**When to use:**
- Hero cells with navigation options
- Section introductions linking to parts
- Tutorial navigation between chapters
- Multi-part content flow
- Quick reference navigation

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Action Cards in Transition Cells

**REQUIRED for Navigation Notebooks:** Every transition cell between parts MUST include action cards.

**Transition Cell Pattern:**
```markdown
### Part 7: Universal Patterns

**Progress: 7 of 8** 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
**Reading time: 2 minutes**

Contextual text explaining what's next...

<!-- action-cards -->

- [Topic 1](#)
- [Topic 2](#)
- [Topic 3](#)
```

**Validation Requirements:**
- ✅ Transition cells MUST have `<!-- action-cards -->` marker
- ✅ Must include 3-6 action card links
- ✅ Links must use `(#)` placeholder pattern
- ✅ Links must resolve to existing headings

**Common Failure:**
```markdown
# ❌ FAILS VALIDATION - Missing action cards
### Part 7: Universal Patterns
**Progress: 7 of 8** 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
**Reading time: 2 minutes**

These patterns work everywhere...
# No action cards marker - VALIDATION FAILS

# ✅ PASSES VALIDATION - Has action cards
### Part 7: Universal Patterns
**Progress: 7 of 8** 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
**Reading time: 2 minutes**

These patterns work everywhere...

<!-- action-cards -->

- [Beyond EDS](#)
- [Universal Patterns](#)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- This is the #1 validation failure (80% of issues)
- Action cards provide visual navigation between parts
- Maintains consistent user experience
- Critical for multi-part navigation notebooks

**Validation Check:**
```bash
/validate-notebook your-notebook.ipynb
```

Will report:
```
TRANSITIONS: ❌ FAIL
  ✗ Part 7 transition (cell 45) missing <!-- action-cards --> marker
  Fix: Add action cards marker with 3-6 links
```

```

**For educational notebooks:**
```
Use the jupyter-educational-notebook skill to create a tutorial about [topic]
```

---

## Visual Consistency Standards (Presentations Only)

**CRITICAL:** All presentation notebooks MUST follow these standards:

### Colors
- **Headings:** `#0d47a1` (dark blue)
- **Text:** `#212121` (dark grey)
- **Border:** `#0288d1` (blue)
- **Background:** `linear-gradient(135deg, #e3f2fd 0%, #bbdefb 100%)`

### Typography
- **H2:** `color: #0d47a1; font-size: 28px; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 24px;`
- **H3:** `color: #0d47a1; font-size: 26px; font-weight: 700; margin-bottom: 16px;`
- **Body:** `color: #212121;`

### Layout
- **Margins:** `margin: 0 0;` (no vertical gaps)
- **Padding:** `padding: 32px;`
- **Border radius:** `border-radius: 12px;`
- **Border:** `border-left: 6px solid #0288d1;`

### Critical Rules
1. ✅ Use HTML headings, NOT markdown (`##`, `###`)
2. ✅ Wrap EDS blocks INSIDE styled containers
3. ✅ Include `color: #212121` on all gradient divs
4. ❌ No vertical margins (creates black gaps)
5. ❌ No markdown headings (render grey)
