## Overview

The EDS (Edge Delivery Services) block architecture employs a sophisticated dynamic loading system that presents unique challenges for advanced performance testing and instrumentation. This guide examines the system's architecture and provides tested strategies for comprehensive block analysis while maintaining code integrity.

**Prerequisites for this guide:**
- ✅ Explicit user request received for advanced debugging
- ✅ Understanding of [standard debugging approaches](debug.md#standard-debugging-workflow)
- ✅ Familiarity with EDS block structure and constraints

## EDS Block Loading Architecture

### Processing Pipeline

The EDS block loading system follows a specific sequence:

1. **HTML Parsing**: The system scans the DOM for elements with block classes
2. **Block Decoration**: Adds metadata and wrapper elements
3. **Resource Loading**: Dynamically loads CSS and JavaScript files
4. **Module Execution**: Executes the block's decoration function
5. **Status Tracking**: Updates block status throughout the process

### Example: Columns Block Loading

For a columns block in HTML:
```html
<div class="columns">
  <!-- block content -->
</div>
```

The system will:
1. Detect the `columns` class
2. Load `/blocks/columns/columns.css`
3. Import `/blocks/columns/columns.js`
4. Execute the default export function with the block element

## Dynamic Injection System

### Import-Based Module Loading

The EDS system uses ES6 dynamic imports for block loading, which creates specific constraints for testing instrumented code:

```javascript
// This is how blocks are loaded dynamically
const mod = await import(`${window.hlx.codeBasePath}/blocks/${blockName}/${blockName}.js`);
```

### Constraints and Limitations

#### 1. **Path Resolution**
- Block paths are constructed dynamically using the block name
- The system always looks for `{blockName}.js` in `/blocks/{blockName}/`
- Cannot be easily redirected to instrumented versions

#### 2. **Module Caching**
- ES modules are cached by the browser
- Once loaded, subsequent imports return the cached version
- Requires page reload to load different versions

#### 3. **Import Timing**
- Blocks are loaded on-demand when encountered in the DOM
- Loading happens during the decoration phase
- Cannot be intercepted without modifying core AEM.js

### Why Direct Import Redirection Doesn't Work

```javascript
// This approach doesn't work because:
// 1. The import path is dynamically constructed
// 2. We can't modify the core AEM.js loading logic
// 3. Module resolution happens at runtime

// Attempted solution (doesn't work):
import { instrumentedDecorate } from './columns-instrumented.js';
// The system still imports './columns.js' directly
```

## Testing Strategy for Instrumented Blocks

> **📋 Policy Reminder**: File replacement operations require explicit user request. Ensure approval has been obtained before proceeding with this section.

### The File Replacement Approach

Given the constraints of the dynamic injection system, the most effective testing strategy is **temporary file replacement**:

#### Core Principle
Replace the original block file with the instrumented version during testing, then restore the original file afterward.

#### Why This Approach Works

1. **Preserves Dynamic Loading**: The EDS system continues to work exactly as designed
2. **No Code Modification**: No changes to core AEM.js or loading logic required
3. **Complete Instrumentation**: Full access to block execution with performance monitoring
4. **Clean Restoration**: Original code integrity maintained through version control

### Implementation Strategy

> **⚠️ Advanced Operation**: This requires explicit user approval per debugging policy.

```bash
# 1. Backup original file
cp blocks/columns/columns.js blocks/columns/columns-original-backup.js

# 2. Replace with instrumented version
cp blocks/columns/columns-instrumented.js blocks/columns/columns.js

# 3. Run tests and collect data
# (Server serves the instrumented version automatically)

# 4. Restore original file
cp blocks/columns/columns-original-backup.js blocks/columns/columns.js

# 5. Clean up backup (optional)
rm blocks/columns/columns-original-backup.js
```

## Step-by-Step Testing Workflow

> **📋 Policy Gate**: Verify explicit user request approval before proceeding with this workflow.

### Phase 1: Preparation

#### 1. Create Instrumented Block Version
```bash
# Ensure instrumented version exists
ls blocks/columns/columns-instrumented.js
```

#### 2. Verify Server is Running
```bash
# Start the development server (standardized port)
npm run debug
# Server runs at: http://localhost:3000
```

#### 3. Backup Original File
```bash
# Create backup of original block
cp blocks/columns/columns.js blocks/columns/columns-original-backup.js
```

### Phase 2: Testing Execution

#### 4. Deploy Instrumented Version
```bash
# Replace original with instrumented version
cp blocks/columns/columns-instrumented.js blocks/columns/columns.js
```

#### 5. Execute Test
```bash
# Open browser to test page
# http://localhost:3000/eds-test-instrumented.html
```

#### 6. Collect Performance Data
```javascript
// In browser console
window.getInstrumentationReport()
window.exportInstrumentationData()
```

### Phase 3: Restoration

#### 7. Restore Original File
```bash
# Restore original block file
cp blocks/columns/columns-original-backup.js blocks/columns/columns.js
```

#### 8. Verify Restoration
```bash
# Confirm original file is restored
git status
# Should show no changes to blocks/columns/columns.js
```

#### 9. Clean Up
```bash
# Remove backup file
rm blocks/columns/columns-original-backup.js
```

### Alternative: Git-Based Workflow

For teams using Git, a more robust approach:

```bash
# 1. Ensure clean working directory
git status

# 2. Replace with instrumented version
cp blocks/columns/columns-instrumented.js blocks/columns/columns.js

# 3. Run tests and collect data
# (Execute testing procedures)

# 4. Restore using git
git restore blocks/columns/columns.js

# 5. Verify restoration
git status
# Should show clean working directory
```

## Technical Rationale

### Why File Replacement is Optimal

#### 1. **Minimal System Impact**
- No modifications to core EDS architecture
- Preserves all existing functionality
- Maintains performance characteristics

#### 2. **Complete Instrumentation Coverage**

### Comparison with Alternative Approaches

#### Approach 1: Import Redirection (Not Feasible)
```javascript
// Problems:
// - Cannot modify dynamic import paths
// - Requires changes to core AEM.js
// - Breaks system architecture
```

#### Approach 2: Proxy/Wrapper Functions (Complex)
```javascript
// Problems:
// - Requires intercepting module loading
// - Complex setup and teardown
// - Potential for introducing bugs
```

#### Approach 3: File Replacement (Recommended)
```javascript
// Benefits:
// - Simple and reliable
// - No system modifications
// - Complete instrumentation
// - Easy restoration
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Instrumentation Overhead
- **Function Wrapping**: ~0.1ms per function call
- **Memory Monitoring**: ~50KB additional memory usage
- **Data Collection**: ~1-2% CPU overhead
- **Storage Impact**: ~100KB per test session

#### Testing Impact
- **Page Load Time**: <5% increase with instrumentation
- **Block Loading**: <10% increase in decoration time
- **Memory Usage**: ~10% increase during testing
- **Network Traffic**: No additional requests

## Best Practices

### Code Integrity Management

#### 1. **Always Use Backups**
```bash
# Create timestamped backups
cp blocks/columns/columns.js blocks/columns/columns-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).js
```

#### 2. **Verify File States**
```bash
# Check file differences
diff blocks/columns/columns.js blocks/columns/columns-instrumented.js

# Verify restoration
git diff blocks/columns/columns.js
```

#### 3. **Automated Restoration**
```bash
# Use trap for automatic cleanup
trap 'git restore blocks/columns/columns.js' EXIT
```

### Testing Workflow Automation

> **📋 Policy Note**: Automated scripts still require explicit user approval for file replacement operations.

#### 1. **Scripted Testing**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-instrumented-block.sh

BLOCK_NAME="columns"
BLOCK_PATH="blocks/${BLOCK_NAME}"
ORIGINAL_FILE="${BLOCK_PATH}/${BLOCK_NAME}.js"
INSTRUMENTED_FILE="${BLOCK_PATH}/${BLOCK_NAME}-instrumented.js"
BACKUP_FILE="${BLOCK_PATH}/${BLOCK_NAME}-backup.js"

# Backup original
cp "$ORIGINAL_FILE" "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Deploy instrumented version
cp "$INSTRUMENTED_FILE" "$ORIGINAL_FILE"

# Run tests
echo "Running instrumented tests..."
echo "Open: http://localhost:3000/eds-test-instrumented.html"
# Add your test commands here

# Restore original
cp "$BACKUP_FILE" "$ORIGINAL_FILE"
rm "$BACKUP_FILE"

echo "Testing complete, original file restored"
```

#### 2. **CI/CD Integration**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/instrumentation-test.yml
name: Block Instrumentation Testing
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test-instrumented-blocks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run instrumented tests
        run: ./scripts/test-instrumented-blocks.sh
      - name: Verify file integrity
        run: git diff --exit-code
```

### Performance Testing Guidelines

#### 1. **Baseline Measurements**
- Test original block performance first
- Establish baseline metrics
- Document expected performance characteristics

#### 2. **Instrumentation Validation**
- Verify instrumented version produces same output
- Check for performance regression
- Validate data collection accuracy

#### 3. **Data Analysis**
- Focus on execution time patterns
- Analyze memory usage trends
- Identify performance bottlenecks

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### 1. **Graceful Degradation**
```javascript
// In instrumented blocks
try {
  // Instrumented functionality
  return instrumentedFunction.apply(this, arguments);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Instrumentation error:', error);
  // Fallback to original functionality
  return originalFunction.apply(this, arguments);
}
```

#### 2. **Automatic Recovery**
```bash
# Recovery script
if [ ! -f "blocks/columns/columns-backup.js" ]; then
  echo "No backup found, using git restore"
  git restore blocks/columns/columns.js
fi
```

#### 3. **Validation Checks**
```bash
# Validate file integrity
if ! node -c blocks/columns/columns.js; then
  echo "Syntax error detected, restoring backup"
  cp blocks/columns/columns-backup.js blocks/columns/columns.js
fi
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

> **📋 Policy Reminder**: All advanced testing scenarios require explicit user approval.

### Multi-Block Testing

#### 1. **Sequential Block Testing**
```bash
# Test multiple blocks in sequence
for block in columns hero carousel; do
  echo "Testing $block block..."
  cp "blocks/$block/$block-instrumented.js" "blocks/$block/$block.js"
  # Run tests
  git restore "blocks/$block/$block.js"
done
```

#### 2. **Parallel Block Testing**
```bash
# Test multiple blocks simultaneously
cp blocks/columns/columns-instrumented.js blocks/columns/columns.js
cp blocks/hero/hero-instrumented.js blocks/hero/hero.js
# Run comprehensive tests
git restore blocks/*/
```

### Performance Regression Testing

#### 1. **Automated Performance Comparison**
```javascript
// Performance comparison script
const originalMetrics = await runTest('original');
const instrumentedMetrics = await runTest('instrumented');

const performanceImpact = {
  loadTime: instrumentedMetrics.loadTime - originalMetrics.loadTime,
  memoryUsage: instrumentedMetrics.memory - originalMetrics.memory,
  functionCalls: instrumentedMetrics.calls - originalMetrics.calls
};

console.log('Performance Impact:', performanceImpact);
```

#### 2. **Threshold-Based Validation**
```javascript
// Validate performance thresholds
const thresholds = {
  maxLoadTimeIncrease: 100, // ms
  maxMemoryIncrease: 1024 * 1024, // 1MB
  maxOverheadPercentage: 10 // 10%
};

if (performanceImpact.loadTime > thresholds.maxLoadTimeIncrease) {
  throw new Error('Load time increase exceeds threshold');
}
```
