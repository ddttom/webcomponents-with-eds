# EDS Development Server Guide

*Related: [EDS Overview](eds.md) | [Debug Guide](debug.md) | [EDS Architecture and Testing Guide](eds-architecture-and-testing-guide.md)*

## Overview

This guide covers the development server setup and configuration for EDS (Edge Delivery Services) block development and testing. The server provides a local development environment with proxy capabilities for seamless integration with external EDS resources.

*See also: [EDS Native Testing Standards](eds-native-testing-standards.md) for testing approaches | [Design Philosophy Guide](design-philosophy-guide.md) for minimal tooling principles*

## Quick Start

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
# Standard development server
node server.js

# Alternative using npm script
npm run debug
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Server Configuration

The development server uses the following configuration:

- **Port**: 3000 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- **Proxy Target**: `https://allabout.network` (configurable via PROXY_HOST)
- **Local Files**: Served from project root directory
- **Fallback**: Missing files proxied to external server

## Server Architecture

### Local-First, Proxy-Fallback Pattern

The development server implements a sophisticated local-first architecture:

1. **Local File Priority**: Files in the project directory are served first
2. **Proxy Fallback**: Missing files are automatically proxied from external server
3. **MIME Type Handling**: Proper content types for all file formats
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when resources are unavailable

*See also: [Raw EDS Blocks Guide](raw-eds-blocks-guide.md) for simple components | [Complex EDS Blocks Guide](complex-eds-blocks-guide.md) for advanced components*

### File Serving Logic

```javascript
// Simplified server logic
if (localFileExists(requestPath)) {
  serveLocalFile(requestPath);
} else {
  proxyToExternalServer(requestPath);
}
```

This pattern enables:
- **Rapid Development**: Edit local files and see changes immediately
- **External Resource Access**: Seamless integration with remote EDS assets
- **Flexible Testing**: Test components with both local and remote dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Standard Development Process

1. **Start Server**: `node server.js`
2. **Edit Files**: Modify blocks, styles, or scripts locally
3. **Test Changes**: Refresh browser to see updates
4. **Debug Issues**: Use browser dev tools and server logs

### File Organization

The server serves files from the project root with this structure:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blocks/                  # EDS blocks (components)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/                  # Global styles and fonts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                 # Core EDS scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                    # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js               # Development server
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.html                  # Test pages
```

### Testing Workflow

**Important**: The EDS development server uses `test.html` files, not `index.html`. This is an intentional architectural decision, not an inconsistency.

```bash
# Access test files at:
http://localhost:3000/blocks/[component]/test.html

# Example:
http://localhost:3000/blocks/floating-alert/test.html
```

## Server Features

### Automatic MIME Type Detection

The server automatically sets correct MIME types for:

- **JavaScript**: `text/javascript`
- **CSS**: `text/css`
- **HTML**: `text/html`
- **Images**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, etc.
- **Fonts**: `font/woff2`, `font/woff`, etc.
- **JSON**: `application/json`

### Proxy Configuration

The server proxies missing files to `https://allabout.network` by default. This can be configured:

```bash
# Set custom proxy target
PROXY_HOST=https://your-eds-site.com node server.js

# Set custom port
PORT=8080 node server.js
```

### CORS Support

The server includes CORS headers for cross-origin requests:

```javascript
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'
'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization'
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Server Logs

The server provides detailed logging:

```
üöÄ Server running at http://localhost:3000
üìÅ Serving files from: /path/to/project
üîó Proxying missing files to: https://allabout.network
üìÑ Main page: http://localhost:3000/server.html
```

### Common Issues

**File Not Found (404)**
- Check file path and spelling
- Verify file exists in project directory
- Check proxy server availability

**MIME Type Issues**
- Server automatically detects most types
- Add custom MIME types if needed
- Check browser console for warnings

**Proxy Failures**
- Verify internet connection
- Check proxy target server status
- Review server logs for error details

### Performance Monitoring

The server logs resource loading:

```
üìÑ Serving local: /styles/styles.css
üîó Proxying: /blocks/header/header.js (5,677 characters)
‚ùå Failed proxy: /fonts/missing-font.woff2 (404)
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Server Setup

For advanced use cases, you can modify `server.js`:

```javascript
// Custom configuration
const config = {
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
  proxyHost: process.env.PROXY_HOST || 'https://allabout.network',
  staticDir: process.cwd(),
  enableLogging: true
};
```

### Environment Variables

Supported environment variables:

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3000)
- `PROXY_HOST`: Proxy target URL
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

### SSL/HTTPS Support

For HTTPS development:

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

# Modify server.js to use HTTPS
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('cert.pem')
};

https.createServer(options, app).listen(3000);
```

## Integration with EDS

### Block Development

The server integrates seamlessly with EDS block development:

1. **CSS Loading**: EDS automatically loads block CSS files
2. **JavaScript Modules**: ES modules work without build processes
3. **Asset Proxying**: External assets load transparently
4. **Hot Reload**: Changes appear immediately on refresh

### Testing Integration

The server supports comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual block testing
- **Integration Tests**: Multi-block scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Load time and memory usage
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance validation

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Clean**: Always start server fresh for testing
2. **Check Logs**: Monitor server output for issues
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test changes frequently
4. **Use Browser DevTools**: Leverage debugging capabilities
5. **Validate Structure**: Ensure proper EDS block structure

### Performance Optimization

1. **Minimize Proxy Requests**: Keep frequently used files local
2. **Optimize Images**: Use appropriate formats and sizes
3. **Cache Static Assets**: Leverage browser caching
4. **Monitor Network**: Watch for unnecessary requests

### Security Considerations

1. **Development Only**: Never use in production
2. **Local Network**: Restrict access to development network
3. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid committing credentials
4. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for sensitive development
