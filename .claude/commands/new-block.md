description: Create a new EDS block following Content Driven Development (CDD) process
---

You are creating a new EDS block. Follow these steps:

1. **Invoke the content-driven-development skill** to start the CDD process
2. The skill will guide you through:
   - Content model design
   - Test content creation
   - Block implementation
   - Testing and validation

**IMPORTANT**:
- Never skip the CDD process when creating new blocks
- Author needs come before developer needs
- Always create test content before writing code

If the user provides a block name as an argument, use it. Otherwise, ask the user:
"What would you like to name this new block?"

After getting the block name, invoke the content-driven-development skill and begin the process.
