## Security Philosophy

This project follows security-first principles while maintaining simplicity:

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduced attack surface through vanilla JavaScript
- **Content Security Policy**: Proper CSP headers for XSS protection
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-conscious default configurations
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are kept current with security patches

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:

### 🔒 Private Reporting (Preferred)

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
   - Go to the Security tab in this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Provide detailed information about the issue

2. **Direct Contact**: Email security concerns to project maintainers
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed reproduction steps
   - Include potential impact assessment

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security implications
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Browser, version, and configuration details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

When contributing to this project:

#### Input Validation
```javascript
// Always validate and sanitize user inputs
function sanitizeInput(input) {
  if (typeof input !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Invalid input type');
  }
  return input.trim().replace(/[<>]/g, '');
}
```

#### Content Security Policy
```javascript
// Use CSP-compliant code
// Avoid inline scripts and styles
// Use nonce or hash for necessary inline content
```

#### DOM Manipulation
```javascript
// Use safe DOM methods
element.textContent = userInput; // Safe
element.innerHTML = sanitizedHTML; // Only with proper sanitization
```

#### Fetch API Security
```javascript
// Validate URLs and use HTTPS
const url = new URL(endpoint);
if (url.protocol !== 'https:') {
  throw new Error('Only HTTPS endpoints allowed');
}
```

### For Users

When implementing this project:

#### Content Security Policy
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" 
      content="default-src 'self'; 
               script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
               style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
               img-src 'self' data: https:;">
```

#### HTTPS Only
- Always serve content over HTTPS
- Use secure cookies when applicable
- Implement HSTS headers

#### Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Test security configurations

## Common Security Considerations

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- All user content is properly escaped
- CSP headers prevent inline script execution
- DOM manipulation uses safe methods

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- API endpoints validate origin headers
- State-changing operations require explicit user action
- SameSite cookie attributes where applicable

### Content Injection
- User-generated content is sanitized
- HTML content is validated before insertion
- Template literals are used safely

### Data Privacy
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Proper handling of user information
- Compliance with privacy regulations

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- ESLint security rules enabled
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular security audits

### Manual Testing
- Code review for security issues
- Penetration testing for major releases
- Browser security feature validation

## Dependencies Security

### Monitoring
- Regular dependency audits
- Automated vulnerability alerts
- Timely security updates

### Minimal Surface
- Only essential dependencies included
- Regular dependency cleanup
- Prefer vanilla JavaScript solutions

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Implement temporary mitigations
   - Notify affected users if necessary

2. **Investigation**
   - Determine root cause
   - Document the incident
   - Identify lessons learned

3. **Resolution**
   - Develop and test fixes
   - Deploy security updates
   - Verify resolution effectiveness

4. **Communication**
   - Public disclosure after fix
   - Security advisory publication
   - Update documentation
