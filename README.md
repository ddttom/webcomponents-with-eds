### **üìÅ Architecture Philosophy**

> **Important**: This project demonstrates **two complementary development approaches**:
> 
> - **`/blocks/` Directory**: Contains EDS-native components following the core philosophy of simple JavaScript, no dependencies, and no build steps
> - **`/build/` Directory**: Contains complex components that use build processes, external dependencies, and modern tooling when sophisticated functionality is required
> 
> Both approaches are valid and designed to coexist, allowing developers to choose the right tool for each component's complexity and requirements.

## üß© Advanced Components

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted EDS Development

### The Challenge with Traditional EDS Workflows

Adobe Edge Delivery Services delivers exceptional performance and fast development cycles. However, the traditional development workflow creates barriers for AI assistance. The multi-system approach - coordinating between code repositories, Google Docs, SharePoint, and deployment branches - works well for human developers but creates an impossible situation for AI assistants.

When you ask an AI to help debug your EDS block, it struggles because:
- **It can't access your Google Docs or SharePoint content**
- **It can't correlate branch changes with document updates**
- **It can't test code against real data from multiple sources**
- **It lacks context about the complete development environment**

This fragmentation means developers miss out on AI's ability to accelerate development, catch bugs early, and suggest architectural improvements.

### The Solution: Local-First Development

This framework transforms EDS development into an AI-friendly environment through a unified local-first approach. Instead of splitting workflows across multiple systems, everything runs locally where AI assistants can participate meaningfully.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Unified Environment**: AI sees code, content, and data in one place
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant testing and debugging without system switching
- **Intelligent Assistance**: AI can suggest improvements with full context
- **Immediate Changes**: Save and refresh - no build delays or deployment waits

### How It Works

The development server implements a **local-first, proxy-fallback architecture**:

1. **Local Priority**: Serves your development files first
2. **Smart Proxying**: Fetches missing assets from production/staging
3. **Unified Testing**: Test blocks with real data without system juggling
4. **AI Visibility**: Complete transparency for AI assistants

This approach maintains all the benefits of EDS (branches, documents, deployment) while enabling AI to participate effectively in your development process.

### AI-Friendly Development Features

**Immediate Feedback Loop:**
- Save a file and refresh your browser - changes appear instantly
- No build process, deployment wait, or document synchronization delays
- AI assistants can test suggestions and see results immediately

**Complete Context Visibility:**
- Work on code and content together in one environment
- Test edge cases without switching between systems
- Debug with full context available to both you and AI
- Server logs show exactly what's happening with each request

**Intelligent Development Assistance:**
- AI can analyze code, test changes, and provide suggestions with full context
- Catch accessibility issues and performance problems in real-time
- Get architectural recommendations based on complete project visibility
- Debug problems as they happen with AI seeing the same environment you do

**Unified Resource Management:**
- Local files take priority for active development
- Production/staging assets automatically proxied when needed
- Choose your data source (staging or production) without configuration changes
- Maintain version control workflow while enabling AI collaboration

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Infrastructure

### Zero-Dependency Development Server
**Advanced Node.js server for EDS development:**

```bash
npm run debug  # Start on http://localhost:3000
```

**Features:**
- **Local-first, proxy-fallback architecture**
- **EDS block structure validation**
- **Automatic asset proxying to remote servers**
- **Comprehensive MIME type support**
- **Real-time error reporting and debugging**

### EDS Testing Framework
**Proper EDS block structure testing:**

```html
<!-- Required EDS Structure -->
<div class="component-name block" data-block-name="component-name" data-block-status="initialized">
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Content goes here</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Build Automation System
**NPX-powered build and deployment:**

```bash
# Build and deploy components
cd build/shoelace-card && npm run deploy

# Development workflows
npm run debug     # EDS testing environment
npm run serve     # Basic HTTP server
npm run validate  # Code quality checks
```

## üì¶ Multi-Environment Support

### Standalone Development
```bash
cd build/shoelace-card
npm run dev  # Vite dev server with hot reload
```

### EDS Integration Testing
```bash
npm run debug  # Node.js server with EDS structure validation
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Using package script (recommended)
cd build/shoelace-card && npm run deploy
# Builds self-contained component and copies to blocks/ directory
```

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

### Deploy Command
The `npm run deploy` command builds finished components and deploys stubs and README to the blocks folder:

```bash
cd build/shoelace-card
npm run deploy
```

This command:
- **Builds self-contained component** with all dependencies bundled
- **Copies to blocks/ directory** for EDS compatibility
- **Creates stub CSS** (styles bundled in JavaScript)
- **Copies documentation** for content authors

### EDS Integration
To use the built system in your EDS project, copy the `blocks/` contents to your repository:

```bash
# Copy built components to your EDS project
cp -r blocks/* /path/to/your/eds-project/blocks/

# Navigate to your EDS project
cd /path/to/your/eds-project

# Commit and push to git
git add blocks/
git commit -m "Add web components with advanced features"
git push origin main
```

The deploy command handles the build process, but final integration requires copying to your EDS repository and committing the changes.

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### EDS Compatibility Testing
- **Proper block structure validation**
- **EDS environment replication**
- **Component isolation testing**
- **Performance monitoring**

### Development Scripts
```bash
npm run lint          # ESLint with automatic fixes
npm run lint:md       # Markdown linting
npm run hint          # Webhint analysis
npm run security      # Security audit
npm run validate      # Complete quality check
```
