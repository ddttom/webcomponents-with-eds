# Web Components with Adobe Edge Delivery Services

A comprehensive development framework for building high-performance web components with Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS). This project provides advanced components, development infrastructure, and build automation for creating sophisticated EDS blocks with modern web technologies.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For EDS Integration
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ddttom/webcomponents-with-eds.git
cd webcomponents-with-eds

# Copy blocks to your EDS project
cp -r blocks/* /path/to/your/eds-project/blocks/
```

### For Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start EDS development server
npm run debug  # http://localhost:3000

# Or start standalone development
cd build/shoelace-card && npm run dev  # http://localhost:5174
```

# Build and deploy to EDS
npx node scripts/build-component.js shoelace-card
```

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted EDS Development

### The Challenge with Traditional EDS Workflows

Adobe Edge Delivery Services delivers exceptional performance and fast development cycles. However, the traditional development workflow creates barriers for AI assistance. The multi-system approach - coordinating between code repositories, Google Docs, SharePoint, and deployment branches - works well for human developers but creates an impossible situation for AI assistants.

When you ask an AI to help debug your EDS block, it struggles because:
- **It can't access your Google Docs or SharePoint content**
- **It can't correlate branch changes with document updates**
- **It can't test code against real data from multiple sources**
- **It lacks context about the complete development environment**

This fragmentation means developers miss out on AI's ability to accelerate development, catch bugs early, and suggest architectural improvements.

### The Solution: Local-First Development

This framework transforms EDS development into an AI-friendly environment through a unified local-first approach. Instead of splitting workflows across multiple systems, everything runs locally where AI assistants can participate meaningfully.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Unified Environment**: AI sees code, content, and data in one place
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant testing and debugging without system switching
- **Intelligent Assistance**: AI can suggest improvements with full context
- **Immediate Changes**: Save and refresh - no build delays or deployment waits

### How It Works

The development server implements a **local-first, proxy-fallback architecture**:

1. **Local Priority**: Serves your development files first
2. **Smart Proxying**: Fetches missing assets from production/staging
3. **Unified Testing**: Test blocks with real data without system juggling
4. **AI Visibility**: Complete transparency for AI assistants

This approach maintains all the benefits of EDS (branches, documents, deployment) while enabling AI to participate effectively in your development process.

### AI-Friendly Development Features

**Immediate Feedback Loop:**
- Save a file and refresh your browser - changes appear instantly
- No build process, deployment wait, or document synchronization delays
- AI assistants can test suggestions and see results immediately

**Complete Context Visibility:**
- Work on code and content together in one environment
- Test edge cases without switching between systems
- Debug with full context available to both you and AI
- Server logs show exactly what's happening with each request

**Intelligent Development Assistance:**
- AI can analyze code, test changes, and provide suggestions with full context
- Catch accessibility issues and performance problems in real-time
- Get architectural recommendations based on complete project visibility
- Debug problems as they happen with AI seeing the same environment you do

**Unified Resource Management:**
- Local files take priority for active development
- Production/staging assets automatically proxied when needed
- Choose your data source (staging or production) without configuration changes
- Maintain version control workflow while enabling AI collaboration

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Infrastructure

### Zero-Dependency Development Server

<div class="component-name block" data-block-name="component-name" data-block-status="initialized">
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>Content goes here</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
