        "- Check that list items contain links with proper format\n",
        "- Ensure you're viewing in notebook mode (supports auto-wrapping)\n",

        "**Issue:** \"Links in action cards don't navigate\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Link text must match heading text somewhere in the notebook\n",
        "- Check heading exists (search for the text in your IDE)\n",
        "- Heading matching is case-insensitive and ignores special characters\n",
        "- If still failing, check browser console for \"Navigation target not found\" messages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Issue:** \"Hamburger menu (\u2630) is empty or missing items\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Hamburger menu only appears in notebook mode paged overlay\n",
        "- Menu shows cells that have headings (h1, h2, h3)\n",
        "- Hero cells (first cell with # heading) are intentionally skipped\n",
        "- Cells without headings don't appear in menu\n",
        "- Make sure cells have proper heading markers (`#`, `##`, `###`)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Issue:** \"Auto-wrapping not applying to my cells\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Auto-wrapping only works in **notebook mode** (`| IPynb Viewer (notebook) |`)\n",
        "- Check the block variation in your markdown table\n",
        "- Verify you're using pure markdown (no manual HTML `<div>` wrappers)\n",
        "- Detection patterns: Hero (index 0 with `# `), Intro (index \u22642 with `## `), Transition (\u22643 lines, no headers)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Issue:** \"My custom HTML styling is being overridden\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:**\n",
        "- Auto-wrapping applies default classes, but you can mix approaches\n",
        "- Use manual HTML `<div>` wrappers for specific cells needing custom styling\n",
        "- Most cells use auto-wrapping, special cells use custom HTML\n",
