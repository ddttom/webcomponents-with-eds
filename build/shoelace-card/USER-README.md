# Shoelace Card Block

A modern, self-contained card component for Adobe Edge Delivery Services that displays dynamic content with numbered badges and immersive modal overlays. This component requires no external dependencies and works immediately when the decorate function is called.

## What It Does

The Shoelace Card block creates beautiful, interactive cards that:
- Display content from your EDS query-index data
- Show numbered badges for easy navigation
- Open full-screen modals with detailed content
- Adapt to any screen size automatically
- Load content dynamically from your published pages
- Work completely self-contained with zero external dependencies

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

Add this block to any EDS document:

```
| shoelace-card |
| :---- |
```

This will display cards using data from `/slides/query-index.json`.

### Custom Data Source

To use different content, specify a custom path:

```
| shoelace-card |
| :---- |
| /products/query-index.json |
```

## Setting Up Your Content

### 1. Create Your Content Structure

Organize your content in a folder (e.g., `/slides/` or `/products/`):

```
/slides/
├── slide-1.md
├── slide-2.md  
├── slide-3.md
├── query-index.xlsx
└── media/
    ├── image1.jpg
    ├── image2.jpg
    └── image3.jpg
```

### 2. Create Individual Pages

Each card needs its own page with the content that appears in the modal:

**Example: slide-1.md**
```markdown
# Amazing Product Features

![Product Image](./media/image1.jpg)

Discover the incredible features that make our product stand out.

## Key Benefits
- Lightning-fast performance
- 99.9% uptime guarantee  
- 24/7 customer support
```

### 3. Create Query Index Spreadsheet

Create `query-index.xlsx` with these columns:

| path | title | description | image | buttonText |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|------------|
| /slides/slide-1 | Amazing Product | Discover incredible features | /slides/media/image1.jpg | Learn More |
| /slides/slide-2 | Customer Success | Real stories from customers | /slides/media/image2.jpg | Read Stories |
| /slides/slide-3 | Get Started | Begin your journey today | /slides/media/image3.jpg | Start Now |

### 4. Publish Your Content

1. Save and publish each individual page
2. Save and publish the query-index.xlsx file
3. The system automatically generates the JSON endpoint

### Images Not Showing
- Check image paths are correct and absolute
- Ensure images are published and accessible
- Verify image formats are supported (JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG)

## Performance & User Experience

### FOUC Elimination

This component implements advanced **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) elimination** to ensure a professional loading experience:

**Image Preloading**: All card images are preloaded in parallel before any content is displayed, preventing the jarring effect of text appearing before images.

**Atomic Rendering**: Cards appear as complete units rather than building up progressively, creating a polished, professional experience.

**Loading States**: Users see a clean animated spinner while content loads, providing clear feedback about the loading process.

**Graceful Fallbacks**: If image preloading fails or times out, the component gracefully falls back to progressive loading while maintaining functionality.

**Performance Benefits**:
- ✅ No progressive text/image building
- ✅ Smooth loading with professional spinner
- ✅ All content appears simultaneously
- ✅ 5-second timeout for slow networks
- ✅ Automatic fallback for failed images

### Loading Behavior

1. **Initial Load**: Component shows loading spinner
2. **Image Preloading**: All images load in parallel (5-second timeout)
3. **Atomic Display**: All cards appear simultaneously with smooth fade-in
4. **Staggered Animation**: Cards animate in with subtle delays for polish

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic cards and add complexity gradually
2. **Test Regularly**: Preview your content to verify it displays correctly
3. **Optimize Images**: Use appropriate sizes and formats for best performance
4. **Keep Content Fresh**: Regular updates keep your cards engaging
5. **Monitor Performance**: Check loading times and user engagement
6. **Image Optimization**: Smaller images load faster and improve the preloading experience</search>
